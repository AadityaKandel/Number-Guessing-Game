# Number-Guessing-Game
This implies a simple math trick and tries to guess your outcome

Update 1: I've added the "Back" button so the user can easily go back and calculate the previous number if they've forgotten or miscalculated it
Update 2: I've added the "Replay" button so the user can easily replay the game without having to re-launch the application again. Furthermore, I've
          also added few adjustments to the button color updates so it only updates its color when necessary rather than updating every time. 
Update 3: I just created an executable of this script. I named it number thinker but the app's title still shows the same name as in the script. 
          It's for those who don't have python installed on their system. Thank You.
