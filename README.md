# Number-Guessing-Game
This implies a simple math trick and tries to guess your outcome

Update 1: I've added the "Back" button so the user can easily go back and calculate the previous number if they've forgotten or miscalculated it
Update 2: I've added the "Replay" button so the user can easily replay the game without having to re-launch the application again. Furthermore, I've
          also added few adjustments to the button color updates so it only updates its color when necessary rather than updating every time.
